# Micro-Project
This micro project is an exercise to practice typing and functional programming modeling principles using Scala. For this first part you are expected to:
 - Model the main data elements using Scala classes, case classe, traits, enums, options, and objects. If you want to include classes that are not in the dataset, you can feel free to add them. Inheritance and the usage of traits are mandatory. Create a data model that reflects the domain as detailed as possible, for instance using class composition, specific methods for each class, and traits/abstract classes when needed. Using shallow modelling is not encouraged.
 - Read the content of the dataset and load them into Scala collections of instances of the classes defined previously.
